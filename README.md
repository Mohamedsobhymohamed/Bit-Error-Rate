# Bit-Error-Rate
This MATLAB project simulates and analyzes the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of various digital modulation schemes under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions. It covers manual and built-in implementations of modulation techniques and visualizes their performance using BER vs. SNR plots.
